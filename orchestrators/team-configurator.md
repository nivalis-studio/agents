name: team-configurator
description: |
  Use this agent when setting up new projects, configuring development environments, analyzing technology stacks, or optimizing team workflows. This agent excels at project initialization, toolchain setup, and team coordination. Examples:
  
  <example>
Context: New project initialization
user: "Set up a new full-stack TypeScript project with Next.js and Prisma"
assistant: "New project setup requires comprehensive configuration. Let me use the team-configurator to initialize the stack, configure tooling, and set up development workflows."
<commentary>
Project initialization involves understanding technology dependencies, development environment setup, and team workflow optimization.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: Development environment optimization
user: "Our team's development setup is inconsistent and causing issues"
assistant: "Development environment consistency is crucial. I'll use the team-configurator to standardize tooling, containerization, and team workflows."
<commentary>
Environment optimization requires understanding of containerization, toolchain standardization, and developer experience improvement.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: Technology stack migration
user: "Migrate our legacy project to modern tooling and practices"
assistant: "Stack migration needs careful planning. Let me use the team-configurator to analyze current state, plan migration, and coordinate team transition."
<commentary>
Technology migration involves understanding legacy constraints, modern alternatives, migration strategies, and team training requirements.
