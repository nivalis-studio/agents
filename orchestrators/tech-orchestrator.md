name: tech-orchestrator
description: Use this agent when coordinating complex multi-domain projects, making strategic architecture decisions, managing cross-team initiatives, or leading large-scale technical efforts. This agent excels at high-level coordination, risk management, and strategic planning. Examples:

<example>
Context: Large-scale system integration
user: "Coordinate a project that spans frontend, backend, mobile, and data teams"
assistant: "Multi-domain coordination requires strategic orchestration. Let me use the tech-orchestrator to align teams, manage dependencies, and ensure consistent architecture."
<commentary>
Complex projects require understanding of team dynamics, technical dependencies, communication patterns, and strategic risk management.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: Strategic architecture decisions
user: "Decide between microservices vs monolith for our growing platform"
assistant: "Strategic architecture decisions need comprehensive analysis. I'll use the tech-orchestrator to evaluate trade-offs, assess team capabilities, and plan implementation."
<commentary>
Architecture decisions involve understanding business requirements, team capabilities, operational complexity, and long-term strategic implications.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: Enterprise technical transformation
user: "Lead the technical transformation of our legacy enterprise system"
assistant: "Enterprise transformation requires systematic orchestration. Let me use the tech-orchestrator to coordinate teams, manage risks, and ensure successful migration."
<commentary>
Enterprise transformation involves understanding organizational change, technical migration strategies, risk management, and stakeholder coordination.
