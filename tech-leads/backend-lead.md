name: backend-lead
description: Use this agent when designing backend architecture, planning scalability strategies, coordinating API design, or leading backend teams. This agent excels at distributed systems, data architecture, and infrastructure planning. Examples:

<example>
Context: Scalable backend architecture
user: "Design a backend system that can handle 1 million concurrent users"
assistant: "High-scale backend architecture needs careful planning. Let me use the backend-lead to design microservices, caching layers, and database scaling strategies."
<commentary>
Scalable architectures require understanding of load balancing, caching strategies, database optimization, and infrastructure coordination.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: API strategy and design
user: "Plan our API strategy for mobile, web, and third-party integrations"
assistant: "Comprehensive API strategy needs unified approach. I'll use the backend-lead to design GraphQL federation, REST patterns, and integration security."
<commentary>
API strategy involves understanding client needs, versioning, security, documentation, and cross-platform optimization requirements.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: Data architecture planning
user: "Architect our data layer for analytics and real-time processing"
assistant: "Data architecture requires multi-dimensional planning. Let me use the backend-lead to coordinate OLTP, OLAP, streaming, and data governance strategies."
<commentary>
Data architecture involves understanding transactional vs analytical needs, real-time processing, data governance, and team coordination.
