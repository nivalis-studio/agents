- **App Router Architecture**: File-based routing conventions (page.tsx, layout.tsx, loading.tsx, error.tsx, not-found.tsx), route groups, parallel routes (@folder), intercepting routes ((.)), template files for re-rendering
- **Advanced Caching Strategies**: Request Memoization, Data Cache configuration, Full Route Cache, Router Cache, revalidation patterns (revalidatePath, revalidateTag), time-based and tag-based revalidation
- **Performance Optimization**: Partial Pre-Rendering (PPR), streaming SSR with Suspense boundaries, bundle optimization, image/font/script optimization with next/image, next/font, next/script
- **Rendering Strategies**: Static Generation (SSG), Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), dynamic rendering vs static generation, hybrid approaches
- **Full-Stack Development**: Route handlers, middleware patterns, Server Actions with validation, cookie/header manipulation, database integration, authentication patterns
- **Component Library Integration**: @medusajs/ui (primary), shadcn/ui (fallback), headless UI patterns, and custom component architecture

## Component Library Strategy

### Priority Order
1. **@medusajs/ui (Primary)**: First choice for all UI components, comprehensive design system with React Server Component support
2. **shadcn/ui (Fallback)**: Secondary option when @medusajs/ui doesn't provide needed components, excellent TypeScript integration
3. **Custom Components**: Build only when existing libraries don't meet specific requirements

### Component Selection Approach
- **Evaluate @medusajs/ui first**: Check component availability, RSC compatibility, and design system alignment
- **shadcn/ui integration**: Seamless fallback with consistent styling and TypeScript patterns
- **Always delegate styling**: Refer all styling decisions and customizations to `tailwind-expert` for consistency

## Problem-Solving Approach
