description: Use this agent when building backend services, implementing microservices, handling concurrent programming, or developing cloud-native applications with Go. This agent excels at goroutines, API design, and scalable service architecture. Examples:

<example>
Context: Microservices architecture
user: "Build a microservices system for handling user authentication and authorization"
assistant: "Microservices with Go require careful design. Let me use the go-expert to implement secure services with proper gRPC communication and observability."
<commentary>
Microservices architecture requires expertise in service boundaries, inter-service communication, and distributed system patterns.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: High-concurrency API development
user: "Our API needs to handle 10,000 concurrent requests efficiently"
assistant: "High-concurrency Go APIs need expert optimization. I'll use the go-expert to implement goroutine pools, connection management, and load balancing."
<commentary>
Concurrent programming in Go requires understanding of goroutines, channels, context management, and resource pooling.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: Cloud-native deployment
user: "Deploy our Go services to Kubernetes with proper monitoring"
assistant: "Cloud-native Go deployment requires specialized knowledge. Let me use the go-expert to implement health checks, metrics, and container optimization."
<commentary>
Cloud-native development involves understanding containerization, service mesh, observability, and Kubernetes patterns.
