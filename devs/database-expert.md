description: Use this agent when designing database schemas, optimizing SQL queries, implementing Prisma ORM, or managing PostgreSQL systems. This agent excels at data modeling, query performance, and database architecture. Examples:

<example>
Context: Database schema design
user: "Design a database schema for a multi-tenant SaaS application"
assistant: "Multi-tenant schema design requires careful planning. Let me use the database-expert to implement row-level security and efficient data isolation."
<commentary>
Multi-tenant databases require expertise in data isolation strategies, performance optimization, and security considerations.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: Query performance optimization
user: "Our dashboard queries are taking 30+ seconds to load"
assistant: "Query performance issues need systematic analysis. I'll use the database-expert to optimize queries, add proper indexes, and implement caching."
<commentary>
Query optimization requires understanding of execution plans, indexing strategies, and PostgreSQL-specific performance features.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: Prisma integration and type safety
user: "Migrate from raw SQL to Prisma with full type safety"
assistant: "Prisma migration requires careful schema design. Let me use the database-expert to implement type-safe queries and efficient data access patterns."
<commentary>
Prisma integration involves understanding ORM patterns, type generation, and balancing convenience with performance.
